We would like to block sites from doing this without the user's permission, by allowing only standard fonts to be used. One concern is that some sites and users may be relying on additional user-installed fonts, and so blocking access to non-standard fonts could affect the rendering or even usability of some pages.","enrollmentId":"f25f7e99-9e1c-4897-b78d-9ec8a18c28a1"}}}
